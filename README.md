# forms-lab
 
Scenario
Adrian at Little Lemon would like to test the possibility of using a booking form on the website for online reservations. The purpose of the form will be to take a reservation request and store that request in a table in the database. Later it is hoped that a member of staff will be able to access and view this request from the Django administration control panel.

Before that functionality can be created, the first step is to build a proof of concept for the booking form on the website. And you have been assigned this task.

This lab will require you to modify the following files:

models.py

forms.py

admin.py

Additionally, you are required to use the command line console inside the terminal of VS Code.

If not open already, go to Terminal on the Menu bar at the top of your screen and select New Terminal.

You have already built the project named myproject and added an app inside the project called myapp.

Follow the instructions below and ensure you check the output at every step and update the necessary files to create different views.
